# Hotfix - Kikitan Translator v1.2.5

This version only fixes the muting bug that wasn't fixed before the update, so I'll be keeping the same changelogs

After a whole year, Kikitan now has a new update!
Normally, this update was going to feature a new Google Gemini based recognizer and desktop audio translation support, but Google killed their free Live API on December 15th and that completely rendered that feature useless as it would require users to pay for the API and I do not want to ask my users to pay for anything. So I will sadly have to put that update on hold until I discover something better.

**New Features:**
*   **Text-Based Translation Input:**
    *   With the button next to the stop button, you can now type on a textbox for translation instead of speaking.
*   **Enhanced Quickstart Menu:**
    *   The quickstart menu now includes essential settings, allowing users to customize basic settings upon initial launch of Kikitan.  This improves the first-run experience and makes it easier to get started!
*   **Message History:**
*   You can now see the history of your messages through a conveniently placed button on the main page!
**Improvements:**
*   Some UI inconsistencies and small bugs are fixed
*   Microphone not being detected sometimes has been fixed!

**Known Issues:**
* If you are having detection issues with your voice not being detected try updating Microsoft Edge. If update doesn't solve the issue, reinstall it from Microsoft's website. If that doesn't solve anything, delete the %localappdata%\com.github.yusufozmen01.kikitantranslator folder and relaunch Kikitan

**Make sure to join the Discord from the button on the main page if you want to submit bug reports!!**

**Future Plans:**
* I will hopefully find a suitable replacement for Gemini so that I can bring the update I have been working on for the past year. Normally, this update was going to get released a long time ago, but I had many things that were causing me to lose focus on things I enjoy and Kikitan so this update is extremely delayed. If you check GitHub, the pull request has been open since more than a year. I apologize for being late with a new update and I genuinely hate Google for removing their free Live API. Seriously, I hate you Google.
