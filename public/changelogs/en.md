# Major Update - Kikitan Translator v1.3.0
This update brings many new features to Kikitan!

**New Features:**

*   **Google Gemini Integration:**
    *   Added support for translation using Google Gemini which should be better than WebSpeech and Google Translate combo that I was using. Still experimental but worth trying.
    *   Gemini will both convert your speech to text and translate for a more natural translation.
*   **Text-Based Translation Input:**
    *   With the button next to the stop button, you can now type on a textbox for translation instead of speaking.
*   **Enhanced Quickstart Menu:**
    *   The quickstart menu now includes essential settings, allowing users to customize basic settings upon initial launch of Kikitan.  This improves the first-run experience and makes it easier to get started!
* **Announcement System:**
    * Implemented an announcement system to deliver important updates, bug fixes, and other relevant information directly to users. 
    * You can also join to the Discord server from the new button next to the external links buttons!

**Improvements:**

*   Some UI inconsistencies and small bugs are fixed

**Bug Fixes:**

**Known Issues:**
* If you are having detection issues with WebSpeech (default recognizer), try updating Microsoft Edge. If update doesn't solve the issue, reinstall it from Microsoft's website.

**Future Plans:**
* Next on the list is translating the desktop audio, so that you won't need everyone to have Kikitan installed. This will most likely require using Gemini, but we will see how things go.
